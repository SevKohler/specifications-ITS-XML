XML schema for use with openEHR systems and tools. See https://specifications.openehr.org/development_baseline[development baseline] of current specifications.

== Releases and IM Versions

NOTE: These schemas are in TRIAL state and subject to change.
An older stable release of openEHR XML schema can be still found at https://github.com/openEHR/specifications-ITS-XML/releases/tag/Release-1.0.2v2[Release-1.0.2].

In order to signal and to avoid breaking changes introduced by a number of ITS JIRA issues, as well as by restructure of this repository,
the new release is going to be a major version, tagged as **Release-2.0.0**.
Simultaneously, the internal namespace used in the schemas is also changed to `http://schemas.openehr.org/v2`.
 
The repository is structured as follows:
